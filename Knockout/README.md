# Challenge Name: Knockout
## Description:
> Iâ€™ve Ceen Many Pictures of Knocking-out in my career
# Solution:
* On Analysing the PCAP file, we are able to see tha there is TCP connection established betweenn ```10.10.0.3``` and ```10.10.0.4``` through the port ```58832```
* On following the TCP stream, there was an conversation having hints about the challenge.
* Another Vital Clue was in the Description, the change of **"Ceen"** from **"Seen"** was doubtfull

* They were mentioning about some images and therefore I tried to extract the images from the PCAP files.

* Tried Stegenography on the images captured.

* But it was not leading anywhere until I figured out that the pictures were meant to re-route us.

* So this lead to dead end.
* But my doubts regarding the challenge being named "Knocking out" and the intentional vocabulary error in the Descripion still persisted.
* I took a look at all the vital protocols inside the PCAP.

* And I came across "ICMP Port Knocking" methord where a client tried to connect to a particular server through a port where it has to parse a firewall.
> In computer networking, port knocking is a method of externally opening ports on a firewall by generating a connection attempt on a set of prespecified closed ports. Once a correct sequence of connection attempts is received, the firewall rules are dynamically modified to allow the host which sent the connection attempts to connect over specific port.

 * This made me check the ICMP packets (Now this makes sense to the vocab mistake in discription "**I** have **C**een **m**any **K**nocking out in....).
 * For a while I was not able to figure out any methord to get the flag or to get any data beneficial for my challenge.
 * Other than somerandome packets to that have:

 * All other ICMP packets where just randome data.
 * SO after really trying to look at the PCAP i found a strange pattern in the length of these packets. 
 * Normally ICMP echo requests or reply are not this long.That too with a sense less data.
 * I came across a strange inference that the length of these packets are in the range of ASCII characters. 
 Just out of curiosity I collected all the length of the packets using a scapy script and tried to convert them to character/string
 ```py
 from scapy.all import *
import os 
packets = rdpcap("Knockout.pcap")
k = []
for i in packets:
        if ICMP in i and i[ICMP].id == int("0x1ee7", 16):
                if i[ICMP].type == 8:
                        k.append(len(i[Raw]))

#print(k)
for i in range(len(k)):
        print(chr(k[(i)]))
```
this gave me the flag as the output
# Flag:
> noxCTF{kn0ck1n6_my_1cmp}
