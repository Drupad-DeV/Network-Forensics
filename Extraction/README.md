# Challenge Name: Extraction 
## Chllenge Description:
> Found this packet capture. Pretty sure thereâ€™s a flag in here. Can you find it!?
# Solution:
* This time the number of packets were less
* And hence it was easy to traverse through them.
* There was a jpeg image being transmitted through them.
* Extracted it using Scapy script
```py
from scapy.all import *
import os
file = rdpcap("Extraction.pcapng")
k = bytes()
count = 0
#print(hexdump(file[12]))
for i in file:
	if TCP in i and len(i)>1000:
		a = bytes(i)
		a = a[66:]
		k += bytes(a)
open('flag.jpg', 'wb').write(k)
```
* Image Extracted

* Which had a zip file inside it

* bruteforced and unzipped

the zip file contained flag.pdf that gives the flag.
